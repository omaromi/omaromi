## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m Omar, an educator, thinker, and forever learner.
- Right now, I work at [projectBasta](https://projectbasta.com/) as a Product Manager.
- Before that, I was a career coach at an education nonprofit and a biochemistry researcher.


- I'm currently learning about programming through Python and JavaScript.
- My background in STEM and education has me diving deeper into data science with python and pandas.
- When I'm not learning, I produce a monthly standup comedy show and tell jokes on stage.


- Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-mn/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ethnicallyomar/)
