## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m Omar, an educator, product manager, and learning addict.
- Right now, I work at [Basta](https://projectbasta.com/) as a Product Manager.
- Before Basta, I was a career coach to first-gen college students and before that, a researcher working on antibiotic drug design.


- I'm currently learning about programming through Python and JavaScript.
- My background in STEM and education has me diving deeper into data science with python and pandas.
- When I'm not coding, I produce a monthly standup comedy show and tell jokes on stage.
