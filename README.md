## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m Omar, an educator, product manager, and learning addict.
- Right now, I work at [Basta](https://projectbasta.com/) as a Product Manager.
- We're building a web app that provides personalized career coaching to first-generation college students.

About Me
- Before Basta, I was a career coach to first-gen college students and before that, a researcher working on antibiotic drug design.
- When I'm not coding, I produce a monthly standup comedy show and tell jokes on stage.

Let's chat!
