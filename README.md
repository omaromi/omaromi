## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m Omar, an educator, builder, and learning addict.
- Right now, I work at [BASTA](https://projectbasta.com/) as a Data Engineer.
- We're building Seekr, an app that gives personalized career advice for first-generation college students.

About Me
- Before BASTA, I was a career coach to first-gen college students and before that, a researcher working on antibiotic drug design.
- When I'm not coding, I produce a monthly standup comedy show and tell jokes on stage.

What I'm learning lately
- Learning to read, write and speak Bengali as my 4th language
- Reading The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon
- Tinkering in Supabase to build a soccer analytics database for my favorite team Arsenal
